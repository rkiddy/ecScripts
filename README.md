# ecScripts

These scripts are useful for me as I manage a set of ec2 instances that I have set up.

I have four instances configured on the aws ec2 service. These do not need to be running most of
the time and are usually stopped. The instances have a tag that is like "use-case" = "&lt;value&gt;". The
value is used as a parameter for the scripts, where this is needed.

TODO This really should be driven by a list of tags and should not have duplicated code for each. But this works.
